**Tauke is company that support better middlemen ecosystem in Indonesia by app**

**Tauke adalah perusahaan yang mendukung terciptanya ekosistem perantara (tengkulak) yang lebih baik di Indonesia melalui Aplikasi**

In Indonesia, Mostly Farmers sell at low prices for their crops because of the Bad Middleman Ecosystem
In Indonesia, farmers do sell their produce to middleman, agents and distributors because they (farmers) dont have proper knowledge about market and time to sell their product.There are three users of our service (app), it is Farmer, Middleman, and Reseller. Our current service users have limitations according to the funds we have. We believe that we will be able to increase the traction of service users with investors who fund us
